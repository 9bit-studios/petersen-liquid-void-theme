# Project Audit Update - August 2025

## Current Status: Project Folder Audit for Unified Configuration

### Overview
We are currently auditing all project folders within 9bit-studios to establish optimal configurations for a unified package.json workspace structure. This audit ensures secure, centralized environment management through our Apple Intelligence Strategic Director framework.

## Critical Security Protocol

### Environment Variable Access
**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: No scripts or services should directly read `.env` or `.env.local` files except through:

1. **Unified TypeScript Configuration**
   - Location: `/Users/pennyplatt/.apple-intelligence-director/unified-config-loader.js`
   - This is the ONLY authorized method for environment access
   
2. **Apple Native Priority Initialization**
   - Dependency: `apple-native-priority-init-enhanced.js`
   - Ensures Apple priority API sourcing before any environment loading
   - Validates all API access through strategic director framework

### Configuration Hierarchy
```
Apple Native Priority Init
         ↓
Unified Config Loader (hidden directory)
         ↓
Service Implementations (Native Frameworks, Start-Services, Frontend/QA Services)
         ↓
Project-Specific Configurations
```

## Completed Updates

### 1. Unified Configuration System
- ✅ Created `unified-config-loader.js` combining env and project configs
- ✅ Moved sensitive configurations to `~/.apple-intelligence-director/`
- ✅ Updated all services to use `config-loader.js` wrapper
- ✅ Removed deprecated `unified-env-loader.js` and `project-config-loader.js`

### 2. Token Architecture Enhancement
- ✅ Integrated unified token architecture with frontend services
- ✅ Created Shopify-enhanced token configuration
- ✅ Established token processing workflow
- ✅ Connected services to unified token system

### 3. Package Management Preparation
- ✅ Cleaned up deprecated dependencies
- ✅ Updated to official `@grid-is/api` package
- ✅ Fixed all npm vulnerabilities
- ✅ Prepared workspace configuration template

## Active Audit Tasks

### Project Discovery
Currently running diagnostic tools to identify:
- All projects with package.json files
- Nested project structures
- Common dependencies across projects
- Project-specific requirements

### Tools Being Used
```bash
# Project scanning
node diagnostic/portable-project-scanner.js
node diagnostic/comprehensive-token-scanner.js
node diagnostic/advanced-pattern-detector.js

# Service validation
node validate-qa-system.js
node diagnostic/validate-frontend-services.js
```

## Validation Framework Status

### QA Validation System (`validate-qa-system.js`)
- Validates entire QA framework integrity
- Checks Apple Native Priority initialization
- Verifies unified configuration loading
- Ensures cross-project consistency

### Frontend Services Validation (`diagnostic/validate-frontend-services.js`)
- Validates all frontend design services
- Checks token architecture integration
- Ensures proper environment loading
- Verifies service dependencies

## Sources of Truth Confirmation

All development must continue to align with:
1. `/apple-intelligence/foundation/sources-of-truth/` - PRIMARY AUTHORITY
2. Strategic Director Framework (`StrategicDirector.swift`)
3. Apple Intelligence validation protocols

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Project Audit**
   - Finish scanning all project directories
   - Document nested project structures
   - Identify shared vs. unique dependencies

2. **Finalize Workspace Configuration**
   - Create unified package.json at root
   - Define workspace members
   - Migrate common dependencies

3. **Update All Services**
   - Ensure all services use unified config loader
   - Remove any direct .env access
   - Validate through QA system

## Security Reminders

- **Never** read .env files directly in code
- **Always** use the unified config loader
- **Ensure** Apple Native Priority init runs first
- **Validate** all configurations through QA system

## Timeline
- Project Audit: In Progress (August 2025)
- Workspace Migration: Pending audit completion
- Full Integration: Target September 2025
